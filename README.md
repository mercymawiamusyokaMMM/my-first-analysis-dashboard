data analytics dashboard that I used Power Bi
**Introduction**
Agriculture is one of the most important sectors in Kenya. It not only feeds millions of people but also provides jobs and income for many families. With farming being such a key part of the economy, it’s important to understand how different crops and regions are performing. That’s where data comes in.

To dig deeper, I created a Power BI dashboard that shows trends in crop production, revenue, profit, and land use across several counties. The dashboard, called Kenya Crop Insights, makes it easy to see which crops bring in the most revenue, which counties are leading in production, and how costs and yields change over time. My goal with this project is to show how data visualization can turn numbers into useful insights that can guide farmers, policymakers, and even investors in making better decisions for the agricultural sector.
The above can be shown using the image below of the dashboard I created

**Overall Highlights (from the dashboard)**
From the dashboard, a few big-picture insights immediately stand out. Kenya’s crop sector generated Ksh 1.19 billion in total revenue, with Ksh 1.10 billion in profit, showing that farming activities across the counties are quite profitable overall. The data also shows a combined total yield of 1.23 million units (depending on whether measured in tons or kilograms) spread across a total land area of 4,930 hectares.

What’s interesting here is the balance between land use and output. Even with less than 5,000 hectares under cultivation, farmers were able to achieve significant returns, pointing to the value of efficient farming practices and crop selection. These figures provide a snapshot of the sector’s strength while also highlighting areas where improvements in land utilization and productivity could unlock even greater results.

**Revenue and Production Costs by Month**
The data shows that revenue is consistently higher than production costs, meaning farming stays profitable throughout the year. However, there are clear ups and downs. Revenue peaks during harvest months, then dips slightly in between seasons. These shifts reflect the seasonal nature of farming in Kenya, where weather patterns and market demand affect performance.

**Revenue by County**
Nyeri leads with the highest revenue at Ksh 162M, followed closely by Nairobi and Nakuru. This can be linked to factors such as fertile soil, better farming practices, good infrastructure, and easier access to markets. These advantages give farmers in these counties higher returns compared to others.

**Land Area & Yield by County**
Nairobi and Kiambu stand out with both large land use and high yields. On the other hand, counties like Mombasa have smaller land areas and lower yields. This shows that productivity isn’t just about land size — good farming practices also play a big role in output.

**Farmer-Level & Filters**
The dashboard can be filtered by crop type, farmer, county, or month. This makes it easy for farmers, policymakers, and investors to drill down into specific details and make better decisions.

**Recommendations**
Invest more in counties with high yield efficiency to maximize returns.
Focus on profitable crops like rice, sorghum, and potatoes.
Support underperforming counties by providing better inputs, irrigation, and access to markets.
**Conclusion**
This analysis shows how data analytics can transform agriculture by making it more efficient and profitable. With tools like Power BI, raw data is turned into clear insights that help farmers, policymakers, and investors make informed decisions. By understanding trends in revenue, yield, and land use, Kenya’s agricultural sector can unlock more opportunities for growth and sustainability.
